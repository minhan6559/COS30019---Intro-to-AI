test cases start with g: Grid-like map
g1 & g4: small size problems
g2 and g5: medium size problems
g3 & g6: large size problems
g7: large size problem with some random edges connecting nodes
g8: extra large problem with multiple goals

test cases start with l: Linear paths
l1 & l4: small size problems
l2 and l5: medium size problems
l3 & l6: large size problems
l7 & l8: large size problem with some random edges connecting nodes

test cases start with n: Problems that have NO SOLUTION

m1: test case with multiple goals, the normal search algorithm will get to goal 2030, 
but an optimal path to visit all the goals should try to visit goal 105 first.
m2: similar to m1, a test case with multiple goals, the normal search algorithm will get to goal 105,
AND an optimal path to visit all the goals should also try to visit goal 105 first.
