# Test Case: Explores informed search with equal-cost paths and varying heuristics.
# The expected outcome is that all algorithms will discover a route to node 8.
# Notably, two paths exist (via node 6 or 7) with a cost of 15.
# DFS and BFS will make their path selection based on their specific search traversal order.
# UCS might select either path given their equal cost from the start (though it will pick node 6 due to its lower ID).
# Informed algorithms (A*, GBFS, BULB) are anticipated to favor the path through node 7 due to its more promising heuristic value.
