#Test Scenario: Tie Resolution Assessment
#Assesses how algorithms manage nodes that have equivalent heuristic values and costs.
#Anticipated outcome:
#- All algorithms should identify path 2, 3, 6, 8 because of the tie-breaking protocols.
#- When similar nodes are located on separate branches, they should be expanded in the order they appear.
#- Presuming all other factors are constant, nodes should be expanded in ascending sequence (with lower node IDs being prioritized).
