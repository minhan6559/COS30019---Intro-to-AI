#Test Scenario: Deceptive Heuristic
#A test to see how algorithms using heuristics respond to deceptive geometric shortcuts.
#Expected outcome:
#- Algorithms that factor in path costs, such as UCS, A*, and BULB, will identify the best route.
#- GBFS will be led astray by the heuristic and choose a more expensive, lengthier route.
#- Shows why search methods based solely on heuristics may not be as good as methods that take g(n) into account.
