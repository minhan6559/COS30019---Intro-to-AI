#Test Scenario: Goal Path Verification
#A test to see if algorithms are able to locate a different goal when the seemingly better path is invalid.
#Predicted outcome:
#- All search algorithms must be able to detect the invalid path and find the alternative path.
#- Although goal 9 may initially appear less appealing, the correct solution is the path 5,7,9.
#- Goal 4 initially appears to have a better heuristic/cost. However, there's no complete path to reach goal 4.
