#Test Scenario: Loop Management Assessment
#A test to check how search algorithms deal with cycles without becoming trapped.
#Predicted outcome:
#- UCS, A*, GBFS, and BULB should quickly locate the exit through node 15.
#- Algorithms need to prevent endless loops by keeping track of visited nodes.
#- DFS might explore further into the cycle before finding the goal.
#- Demonstrates how crucial it is to have proper loop detection in search strategies.
