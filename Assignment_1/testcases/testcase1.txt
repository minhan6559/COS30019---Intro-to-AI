# Test Case 1: Basic Path Finding
# Tests basic pathfinding with multiple destination options.
# Expected behavior: 
# - DFS will expand deep into path 1→2→5→8
# - BFS will expand each level and find a path to node 7
# - Cost-based algorithms (UCS, A*, Fringe) will take path 1→2→5→8 due to lower total cost
# - GBFS will take path 1→4→7 since it follows the shortest geometric path
