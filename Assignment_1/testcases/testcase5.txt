# Test Case 5: Goal Path Validity Test
# Tests whether algorithms can find an alternative goal when the seemingly better path is invalid
# Expected behavior: 
# - Goal 9 appears to have better heuristic/cost initially
# - However, there's no complete path to reach goal 9 
# - All search algorithms must be able to detect the dead end and find the alternative path
# - Correct solution is path 1→2→4→6→8 despite goal 8 seeming less attractive initially
