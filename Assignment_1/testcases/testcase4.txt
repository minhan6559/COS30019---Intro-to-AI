# Test Case 4: Tie-break Test
# Tests how algorithms handle nodes with identical costs and heuristic values
# Expected behavior: 
# - When all else is equal, nodes should be expanded in ascending order (smaller node IDs first)
# - When equal nodes are on different branches, they should be expanded in chronological order
# - All algorithms should find path 1→2→5→7 due to the tie-breaking rules
