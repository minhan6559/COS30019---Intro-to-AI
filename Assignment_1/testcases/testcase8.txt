# Test Case 8: Equal-Cost Paths with Different Heuristics
# Tests how informed algorithms handle multiple paths with identical costs but different heuristic values
# Expected behavior: 
# - All algorithms find path to node 7
# - Both paths (via node 5 or node 6) have identical total cost of 11
# - Informed algorithms (A*, GBFS, Fringe) should prefer path through node 6 due to better heuristic
# - UCS may choose either path as they have equal cost (but will choose node 5 since node ID is smaller)
# - DFS and BFS will choose based on their exploration order
