# Test Case 11: Greedy Trap Causing Unreachable Goals
#
# Tests how greedy multi-goal search can fail when early local decisions block access to future goals.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Ideally, visiting goals in the order (7 → 6 → 8 → 9) would allow all goals to be reached.
# - However, the greedy algorithm picks the nearest goal (node 6) first.
# - After reaching 6 and 8, it cannot backtrack to 7 or 9 due to directed paths and no reverse edges.
# - Warnings are issued for unvisited goals (7 and 9), and only reachable goals (6 and 8) are included in the final path.
# - Demonstrates the limitation of greedy nearest-goal-first: locally optimal choices can create dead-ends and prevent full goal coverage.
# Highlights the need for global planning or lookahead to solve multi-goal problems properly (Travelling salesman problem).
