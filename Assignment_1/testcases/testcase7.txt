# Test Case 7: Worst-Case for Uninformed Search
# A structure where DFS and BFS must explore almost the entire graph
# Expected behavior: 
# - DFS and BFS perform poorly, expanding most nodes due to unfavorable node ordering
# - UCS finds the optimal path efficiently despite being uninformed, thanks to path costs
# - Informed searches (A*, GBFS, Fringe) perform best by directly heading toward the goal
# - Demonstrates how node ordering and exploration strategy can severely impact performance
